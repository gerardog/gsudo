**gsudo** is a `sudo` equivalent for Windows, with a similar user-experience as the original *nix sudo.
It allows to run commands with elevated permissions. No switching to another console required.

Internally when you call **gsudo**, it launches itself elevated as a background process in "service mode". This will open the Windows UAC pop-up once. The requested command is then ran by the elevated service and attached or streamed to the user-level console. The service stays running in the background just in case you need to elevate again soon, without another UAC pop-up. The service process shutdowns automatically after idling for 5 minutes (configurable).

## Instalation

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh) users: 

``` batch
scoop install gsudo
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) users:

Choco has a ~20 days delay until new submitted versions are approved, so in order to get the latest, do...

``` batch
:: List all versions submitted
choco list "sudo" --all
:: Install the latest version number
choco install gsudo --version=x.x.x
```

Manual installation:

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo/releases/latest). Unzip to a local folder. Then either add it to the path or you can alias the `sudo` keyword to `gsudo` with:
 `mklink "C:\windows\system32\sudo.exe" "C:\FullPathTo\gsudo.exe"`.

## Features

- Elevated commands are shown in the user-level console. (Unless you specify `-n` which opens a new window.)
- Credentials cache: If `gsudo` is invoked several times within minutes it only shows the UAC pop-up once.
- CMD commands: `gsudo md folder` (no need to use the longer form `gsudo cmd.exe /c md folder`)
- PowerShell commands [can also be elevated](#Usage-from-PowerShell).
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key press is correctly forwarded to the elevated process. (eg. cmd/powershell shells won't die, but ping/nslookup/batch file will.
- Scripting: 
  - `gsudo` can be used on scripts that requires to elevate one or more commands. (the UAC popup will appear once). 
  - Outputs of the elevated commands can be interpreted: E.g. StdOut/StdErr can be piped or captured (`gsudo dir | findstr /c:"bytes free" > FreeSpace.txt`) and exit codes too ('%errorlevel%)). If `gsudo` fails to elevate, the exit code will be 999.
  - If `gsudo` is invoked (with params) from an already elevated console it will just run the command. So you don't have to worry if you run `gsudo` or a script that uses `gsudo` from an already elevated console. It also works. (The UAC popup will not appear)

## Usage

Note: You can use anywhere the `gsudo` command or the `sudo` alias created by `Scoop` or `Chocolatey` installers.

```gsudo```
Opens an elevated shell in the current console.

```gsudo [options] {command} [arguments]```
Executes the specified command with elevated permissions.

Most relevant **`[options]`**:

- **`-n | --new`**        Starts the command in a **new** console with elevated rights (and returns immediately).
- **`-w | --wait`**       Force wait for the process to end (and return the exitcode).
- **`--copyev `**         Copy all environment variables to the elevated session before executing.
- **`--copyns `**         Reconnect current connected network shares on the elevated session. Warning! This is verbose, affects the elevated user system-wide (other processes), and can prompt for credentials interactively.
- **`--debug `**          Debug mode (verbose).

```gsudo config```
Show current-user settings.

```gsudo config {key} ["value" | --reset]```
Read, write, or reset a user setting to the default value.

Examples:

``` batch
sudo notepad %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
sudo md "C:\Program Files\MyApp"
sudo DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

# spawn PowerShell in a new console window
sudo -n powershell

# launch in new window and wait for exit
sudo -n -w powershell

# redirect/pipe input/output/error
sudo dir | findstr /c:"bytes free" > FreeSpace.txt

# Configure Reduced logging
sudo config LogLevel "Error"
# Configure Special Elevated Prompt
sudo config Prompt "$P [elevated]$G "
# Reset default Elevated Prompt
sudo config Prompt --reset
```

### Usage from PowerShell

`gsudo` detects if it's invoked from PowerShell and allows the following syntax to elevate PS commands.
You can pass a string literal with the command that needs to be elevated. [PowerShell Quoting Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_quoting_rules) apply. Note that `gsudo` returns a string that can be captured, not powershell objects.

`PS C:\> gsudo 'powershell string command'`

Examples:

``` PowerShell

$file = ".\My Secret.txt"
$algorithm = "sha256"

# On strings enclosed in single quotation marks ('), escape " with \"
$hash = gsudo '(Get-FileHash \"C:\My Secret.txt\").Hash'
# For variable substitutions, use double-quoted strings with single-quotation marks inside
$hash = gsudo "(Get-FileHash '$file' -Algorithm $algorithm).Hash"
# or escape escape " with \""
$hash = gsudo "(Get-FileHash \""$file\"" -Algorithm $algorithm).Hash"

# Test gsudo success (optional):
if ($LastExitCode -eq 999 ) {
    'gsudo failed to elevate!'
} elseif ($LastExitCode) {
    'Command failed!'
} else { 'Success!' }
```

### Usage from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

On WSL, elevation and `root` are different concepts. WSL is a user application,`root` allows full administation of WSL but not the windows system. Use WSL's native `su` or `sudo` to gain `root` access. To get admin priviledge on the Windows box you need to elevate the WSL process. `gsudo.exe` allows that.
Use `gsudo.exe` or `sudo.exe` alias...(Add `.exe`!)

``` bash
# elevate default shell
PC:~$ gsudo.exe wsl

# run elevated Linux command
PC:~$ gsudo.exe wsl -e mkdir /mnt/c/Windows/MyFolder

# run elevated Windows command
PC:~$ gsudo.exe notepad C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
PC:~$ gsudo.exe "notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
gsudo.exe cmd /c "echo 127.0.0.1 www.MyWeb.com >> %windir%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"

# test for gsudo and command success
retval=$?;
if [ $retval -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Success";
elif [ $retval -eq $((999 % 256)) ]; then # gsudo failure exit code (999) is read as 231 on wsl (999 mod 256)
    echo "gsudo failed to elevate!";
else
    echo "Command failed with exit code $retval";
fi;
```

## Known issues

- `Scoop` shim messes [CTRL-C behaviour](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/issues/1896). ([Upvote this!](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/issues/3634)) `Chocolatey` not afected, because as Choco installs elevated I could change the install to create a symbolic links instead of a shim. Quick fix, open CMD as admin:

``` batch
del %userprofile%\scoop\shims\gsudo.exe
del %userprofile%\scoop\shims\sudo.exe
mklink %userprofile%\scoop\shims\gsudo.exe %userprofile%\scoop\apps\gsudo\current\gsudo.exe
mklink %userprofile%\scoop\shims\sudo.exe %userprofile%\scoop\apps\gsudo\current\gsudo.exe
```

- Elevated instances do not share the non-elevated user environment variables or network drives. This is not actually a `gsudo` issue but how Windows works. Options `--copyEV` and `--copyNS` replicates Environment Variables and Network Shares into the elevated session, but they are not bi-directional nor flawless. Network share reconnection can prompt for user/password.

## FAQ

- Why `gsudo` instead of just `sudo`?

When I created `gsudo`, there were other `sudo` packages on most Windows popular package managers such as `Chocolatey` and `Scoop`, so I had no other choice to pick another name. `gsudo` installers on Scoop and Chocolatey create aliases for `sudo`, so feel free to use the `sudo` alias on your command line to invoke `gsudo`.

- Why `.Net Framework 4.6`?

Because 4.6 is included in every Windows 10 installation. `.Net Core` requires additional installation steps and provides no substantial benefit since gsudo is Windows-specific, (other platforms can use the standard *nix sudo.)
