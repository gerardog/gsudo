    <summary>gsudo is a `sudo` for Windows with a similar user-experience as *nix sudo.</summary>
    <description>
`gsudo` allows to run commands with elevated permissions within the current console. 
It is a `sudo` equivalent for Windows, with a similar user-experience as the original *nix sudo.

Elevated commands are shown in the caller (non-elevated) console, no switching to another console required.
